<h3>MBTI personality type: INTJ </h3>
<p><cite>My Personality Test and 16 Personalities</cite></p>
<table>
<tr>
	<th><p>Introverted</p></th>
	<th><p>Intuitive</p></th>
	<th><p>Thinking</p></th>
	<th><p>Judging</p></th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Thought oriented, reserved, reflective, observant</p></td>
	<td><p>Imaginative, future oriented, conceputal, abstract</p></td>
	<td><p>Logical, reasonable, level headed, values fairness</p></td>
	<td><p>Organised, systematic, achievement oriented, planner</p></td>
</table>
<p><b>INTJs make up 2.9% of the population:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Strategic, and goal-oriented – great at solving problems</li><br>
	<li>Able to see the “big picture” and consider large theoretical ideas</li><br>
	<li>Independent, innovative, and resourceful</li><br>
	<li>Very insightful and intuitive, and make many decisions based off of this</li><br>
	<li>Natural leaders, but are also willing to be followers if they trust the person in charge</li><br>
	<li>Adaptable, and are bored by repetition and routine</li><br>
	<li>Calm and analytical</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>Workplace habits:</b></p>
<p>What Architects (INTJs) want – wherever they may be in their careers – is to pursue their professional goals according to their own standards. And if any personality type has high standards for themselves, it’s almost certainly Architects.<br><br>
In theory, this attitude makes for a model employee and coworker. And in many ways, Architects are exactly that. But some personality types may find it a challenge to work with Architects. Architects may be harsh or dismissive toward people they don’t respect – and unfortunately, losing their respect can be all too easy. In particular, they have little time for coworkers who prioritize convenience over innovation or socializing over success. <cite>(16 Personalities)</cite></p>
<h3>Learning style: Solitary (Intrapersonal)</h3>
<p><cite>Learning Styles Online</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a solitary style, you are more private, introspective and independent. You can concentrate well, focusing your thoughts and feelings on your current topic. You are aware of your own thinking, and you may analyze the different ways you think and feel.<br><br>
You spend time on self-analysis, and often reflect on past events and the way you approached them. You take time to ponder and assess your own accomplishments or challenges. You may keep a journal, diary or personal log to record your personal thoughts and events.<br><br>
You like to spend time alone. You may have a personal hobby. You prefer traveling or holidaying in remote or places, away from crowds.<br><br>
You feel that you know yourself. You think independently, and you know your mind. You may have attended self-development workshops, read self-help books or used other methods to develop a deeper understanding of yourself.<br><br>
You prefer to work on problems by retreating to somewhere quiet and working through possible solutions. You may sometimes spend too much time trying to solve a problem that you could more easily solve by talking to someone.
You like to make plans and set goals. You know your direction in life and work. You prefer to work for yourself, or have thought a lot about it. If you don't know your current direction in life, you feel a deep sense of dissatisfaction.<br><br>
</p>

<h3>Team role:</h3>
<p><cite>Psychology Today</cite></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Good interpersonal skills</li>
	<li>Able to work with your team to resolve problems</li>
	<li>Able to communicate effectively during teamwork</li>
	<li>Able to manage the different tasks, goals and other aspects of teamwork</li>
	<li>Good at setting team goals</li>
	<li>Skilled at planning and coordinating with teammates</li>
</ul>
<b><p>Potential Strengths:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Are sometimes able to resolve conflict with teammates</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>Limitations:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Seem to prefer individual work over teamwork</li></p>
</p>
</ul><br>
<p>The results show I am strong in completing solitary tasks that challenge me, but weak when completing repetitive or ‘boring’ tasks.  I can lose focus quickly if I feel a task isn’t ‘useful’ or ‘signifcant’.<br><br>
I need to be aware of a tendancy to want to ‘do it myself’ instead of seeking assistance from team members.  I need to remind myself that others have different ways of operating and that doesn’t always mean they’re less effective.<br><br>
A team should (where possible) be a blend of different personality types.  Difference can be useful as long as the team as a whole is open to listening to the ideas and thoughts of the other members.<br><br><br><br>
