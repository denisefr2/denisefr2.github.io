<h3>Why IT?</h3>
 <p>I find all facets of technology fascinating. Particuarly how games can be used to make entertainment accessible to everyone.  Accessible entertainment can help stimulate the brain, train reflexes and keep those who might otherwise disengage, active and involved.<br><br>
I’ve been interested in technology and how things work for most of my life.  That interest was confined to personal hobbies until the past 20 years or so.  In that time I’ve been empoyed in various IT related roles, including first and second level support, technical training and as a technical specialist.  Working with business related front-end technology has only increased my interest and ‘need to know’.<br><br>
Although I currently live in Brisbane, I grew up in Melbourne.  As such, I’ve always thought of RMIT as a ‘place to go’ for quality education.  When I took the decision to take up studying toward a degree, not only was RMIT on my ‘wish list’ but I found that the subjects that most interested me were available online with RMIT via Open University.<br><br>
My goal is to learn as much as possible about a range of subjects that will satisfy my 'need to know' about databases, programming, web development and information technology generally.  At this point I’m particularly interested in databases and programming but I’m certain as time passes and I gain more knowledge, that will change.  I have an inkling that I’d love to try my hand at making a game of my own and any skills that might contribute towards that goal will be keenly pursued.<br>
