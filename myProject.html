<h3>Project</h3>
  <p>My project is a browser based, single player, role playing game.  The game will be story focussed, include both text, audio and puzzle interactions.  There will be branching storylines dependant on user choice enhancing replayability.<br><br>
Browser based games aren’t unusual, however, they are often created with the aim of ‘time gating’ or selling access to content and items, either immediately or after a short time of play.  The predatory leanings of developers can often lead to issues with users spending more money then they are able to, or being blocked from content when unwilling to spend money. <br><br>
The aim of this project would be to create a game open to anyone to play, with no cost required during the life of the story.  Progression won’t be blocked by a required purchase.<br><br>
  
The game will offer the following features at launch:<br><br>

	<b>Character creation</b><br><br>
The user will be able to select from a range of races, genders with as much scope to customise the appearance of their characters allowed by the engine/platform.<br><br>
Each race will have base statistics that will affect their compatibility with particular classes.  The concept is similar to Dungeons & Dragons but is not intended to be as prescriptive. <cite>(See The Gamer)</cite>.  The range of races and classes will be limited at launch but more may be added over time dependant on take up.<br><br>
On completion of character creation, the user will start the game by choosing an initial path.  The story will branch dependant on user choice and dialog options taken with non-player characters.<br><br>
<b>Exploration</b><br><br>
As the game will be browser based, it is intended that any combat will be primitive in nature and not depicted in any great detail.  The main focus of the game is intended to be story and most conflicts will arise from that.
The game will release with two maps, with more to be added in stages.  This won’t be an open world and travel will be depicted using a graphic rather than real time via characters walking between destinations.<br><br>
It is intended that each map will hold 10 minor hubs with one major hub per map.  The major hub will hold the inns (or resting place), which serves as the base for all player interactions with merchants and rest areas.<br><br>
The minor hubs will be village/small town areas with quest givers, crafting stations and short term rest areas.<br><br>
<b>Crafting</b><br><br>
A basic but complete crafting mechanic will be available.  It will not be compulsory but will however work as an adjunct for users to create armour, weapons and other items that may be required during the game.<br><br>
The crafting mechanics will include gathering resources, creating components and finally creating the final item.
Local tradespeople in the minor hubs will offer receipes, tools and other items for sale for in game currency.<br><br>
<b>Currency</b><br><br>
In game currency will be earned from quest givers and other non playable characters by completing quests, assisting with tasks, such as harvesting, animal husbandry and manual labour.  Currency may also be earned while travelling between hubs from non player characters with puzzles and other problems the player might want to solve.
It is intended that there will be sufficient ways to earn currency whether the user takes part in a facets of the game or not.<br><br>
<b>Story</b><br><br>
As mentioned, the game will be story focussed, with all activties the player takes part in contributing to world building.  Each non player character will play a part in immersing the player in the the game world.
There will be multiple branches to the story, where each decision the player takes, every quest giver missed, changes both the journey and the conclusion.  Replayability is key in the longevity of any role playing game and it the prime consideration of this game’s design.<br><br>
At this point in planning, it is intended to utilize the following during creation:<br><br>
<table>
<tr><th><p>Software</p></th>
	<th><p>Licence model</p></th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Unreal Engine 4</p></td>
	<td><p>Free for development<br>
		Publisher licence requires payment of a percentage of profits <cite>(see Unreal)</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>				
	<td><p>Unreal Engine HTML5</p></td>
	<td><p>Free to use <cite>(see Github)</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Yo Scenario</p></td>
	<td><p>Free to use <cite>(see Yo Scenario)</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Assets and 3d models</p></td>
	<td><p>Differing pricing models <cite>(see Hum3D)</cite></td></p>
</tr>
</table>
<p>There shouldn’t be any additional hardware required outside of existing personal computer and laptop.<br><br>
There will be an initial learning curve while learning the Engine and how to create the HTML5 code with that.  Unreal is a widely used engine and there are numerous resoures available for learning, including those available from Epic Games, the creater and owner of the engine. <cite>(see Unreal Engine)</cite>.<br><br>
Along with the engine, tools are available to assist in the creation and mapping of branching story writing <cite>(See Yo Scenario)</cite>.<br><br>
It should be reasonable to expect that with an initial time investment that the skills required to start the project can be gained.  Once the project has started, the work itself will aid in the growth of further skills.<br><br>
If the project is succesfully launched and uptake by users is good, we can perhaps hope that we can demonstrate that good, free games can be developed without the need to prey on sometimes vulnerable users.
