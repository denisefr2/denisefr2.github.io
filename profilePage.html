<p>I’m a gamer.  I have been since the early 1980s.  Gaming is both my hobby and my relaxation.  I’m keenly interested in how games are created, both from technological and story telling perspective.  <br><br>
My first games were first person shooters but once I discovered role playing games, I looked for more story in all types of games.<br><br>
Nothing satisfies me more than being immersed in a digital story that gives a ‘wow that’s clever’ feeling.

<div id="myIT" class="tabcontent">
<div style="margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;padding:20px 16px;height:800px;">
 <p>I find all facets of technology fascinating. Particuarly how games can be used to make entertainment accessible to everyone.  Accessible entertainment can help stimulate the brain, train reflexes and keep those who might otherwise disengage, active and involved.<br><br>
I’ve been interested in technology and how things work for most of my life.  That interest was confined to personal hobbies until the past 20 years or so.  In that time I’ve been empoyed in various IT related roles, including first and second level support, technical training and as a technical specialist.  Working with business related front-end technology has only increased my interest and ‘need to know’.<br><br>
Although I currently live in Brisbane, I grew up in Melbourne.  As such, I’ve always thought of RMIT as a ‘place to go’ for quality education.  When I took the decision to take up studying toward a degree, not only was RMIT on my ‘wish list’ but I found that the subjects that most interested me were available online with RMIT via Open University.<br><br>
My goal is to learn as much as possible about a range of subjects that will satisfy my 'need to know' about databases, programming, web development and information technology generally.  At this point I’m particularly interested in databases and programming but I’m certain as time passes and I gain more knowledge, that will change.  I have an inkling that I’d love to try my hand at making a game of my own and any skills that might contribute towards that goal will be keenly pursued.<br>

This position works within client requirements to create client a cloud service with attendant applications.  The company is looking for a developer to work in a team on a new project, creating everything from the ground up.<br><br>
The position requires experience with a range of commonly used web development languages and tools.  Javascript tools: React <cite>(React, A JavaScript library for building user interfaces)</cite> Webpack <cite>(Webpack, Bundle your assets)</cite> and Redux <cite>(Redux, A predictable state container for js apps)</cite>; along with HTML, CSS, HTTP and REST <cite>(Restful API)</cite>.<br><br>
The employer has advertised for a ‘front end developer’ but it appears they also require some experience with back end development and APIs.  This might be limited to ensuring the front end component works seamlessly with the Back end and thus ‘supports’ it,  however it appears that some back end experience, particularly with databases and database languages (eg SQL) are necessary.<br><br>
They are asking for 3 years experience as a minimum and place significant emphasis on collaboration within the team and generally.  However, it seems some independent decision making will also be required of the successful applicant.<br><br>
I am currently unsuitable for the position as advertised.  I have familiarity with some of the concepts but no real hands on.<br><br>
I do, however, have extensive experience working in teams, both for projects and long term.  I am also very experienced in making independent decisions to resolve issues in my work.<br><br>
I have in the past, worked in a minor way with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but would in no way represent my skills as ‘experienced’.  I will require significant training to skill up to the requisite level for this position.
To skill up with the requisite skills, I will continue to work towards the Bachelor of Information Technology degree, focussing where possible on subjects that will allow me to learn web development skills.<br><br>
Outside of formal study, I will develop web pages and applications until I am confident in my design skills.  I will seek out other avenues of training in areas that particularly need development, ie, java script, back end apis and UI design.<br><br>
As I am ‘starting from scratch’ and skilling up, there will be a significant time investment required before I am able to do more than learn.

	<td><p>Organised, systematic, achievement oriented, planner</p></td>
</table>
<p><b>INTJs make up 2.9% of the population:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Strategic, and goal-oriented – great at solving problems</li><br>
	<li>Able to see the “big picture” and consider large theoretical ideas</li><br>
	<li>Independent, innovative, and resourceful</li><br>
	<li>Very insightful and intuitive, and make many decisions based off of this</li><br>
	<li>Natural leaders, but are also willing to be followers if they trust the person in charge</li><br>
	<li>Adaptable, and are bored by repetition and routine</li><br>
	<li>Calm and analytical</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>Workplace habits:</b></p>
<p>What Architects (INTJs) want – wherever they may be in their careers – is to pursue their professional goals according to their own standards. And if any personality type has high standards for themselves, it’s almost certainly Architects.<br><br>
In theory, this attitude makes for a model employee and coworker. And in many ways, Architects are exactly that. But some personality types may find it a challenge to work with Architects. Architects may be harsh or dismissive toward people they don’t respect – and unfortunately, losing their respect can be all too easy. In particular, they have little time for coworkers who prioritize convenience over innovation or socializing over success. <cite>(16 Personalities)</cite></p>
<h3>Learning style: Solitary (Intrapersonal)</h3>
<p><cite>Learning Styles Online</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a solitary style, you are more private, introspective and independent. You can concentrate well, focusing your thoughts and feelings on your current topic. You are aware of your own thinking, and you may analyze the different ways you think and feel.<br><br>
You spend time on self-analysis, and often reflect on past events and the way you approached them. You take time to ponder and assess your own accomplishments or challenges. You may keep a journal, diary or personal log to record your personal thoughts and events.<br><br>
You like to spend time alone. You may have a personal hobby. You prefer traveling or holidaying in remote or places, away from crowds.<br><br>
You feel that you know yourself. You think independently, and you know your mind. You may have attended self-development workshops, read self-help books or used other methods to develop a deeper understanding of yourself.<br><br>
You prefer to work on problems by retreating to somewhere quiet and working through possible solutions. You may sometimes spend too much time trying to solve a problem that you could more easily solve by talking to someone.
You like to make plans and set goals. You know your direction in life and work. You prefer to work for yourself, or have thought a lot about it. If you don't know your current direction in life, you feel a deep sense of dissatisfaction.<br><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Team role:</h3>
<p><cite>Psychology Today</cite></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Good interpersonal skills</li>
	<li>Able to work with your team to resolve problems</li>
	<li>Able to communicate effectively during teamwork</li>
	<li>Able to manage the different tasks, goals and other aspects of teamwork</li>
	<li>Good at setting team goals</li>
	<li>Skilled at planning and coordinating with teammates</li>
</ul>
<b><p>Potential Strengths:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Are sometimes able to resolve conflict with teammates</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>Limitations:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Seem to prefer individual work over teamwork</li></p>
</p>
</ul><br>
<p>The results show I am strong in completing solitary tasks that challenge me, but weak when completing repetitive or ‘boring’ tasks.  I can lose focus quickly if I feel a task isn’t ‘useful’ or ‘signifcant’.<br><br>
I need to be aware of a tendancy to want to ‘do it myself’ instead of seeking assistance from team members.  I need to remind myself that others have different ways of operating and that doesn’t always mean they’re less effective.<br><br>
A team should (where possible) be a blend of different personality types.  Difference can be useful as long as the team as a whole is open to listening to the ideas and thoughts of the other members.<br><br>

<div id="myProject" class="tabcontent">
<div style="margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%; padding:20px 16px;height:1000px;">
 <h3>Project</h3>
  <p>My project is a browser based, single player, role playing game.  The game will be story focussed, include both text, audio and puzzle interactions.  There will be branching storylines dependant on user choice enhancing replayability.<br><br>
Browser based games aren’t unusual, however, they are often created with the aim of ‘time gating’ or selling access to content and items, either immediately or after a short time of play.  The predatory leanings of developers can often lead to issues with users spending more money then they are able to, or being blocked from content when unwilling to spend money. <br><br>
The aim of this project would be to create a game open to anyone to play, with no cost required during the life of the story.  Progression won’t be blocked by a required purchase.<br><br>
  
The game will offer the following features at launch:<br><br>

	<b>Character creation</b><br><br>
The user will be able to select from a range of races, genders with as much scope to customise the appearance of their characters allowed by the engine/platform.<br><br>
Each race will have base statistics that will affect their compatibility with particular classes.  The concept is similar to Dungeons & Dragons but is not intended to be as prescriptive. <cite>(See The Gamer)</cite>.  The range of races and classes will be limited at launch but more may be added over time dependant on take up.<br><br>
On completion of character creation, the user will start the game by choosing an initial path.  The story will branch dependant on user choice and dialog options taken with non-player characters.<br><br>
<b>Exploration</b><br><br>
As the game will be browser based, it is intended that any combat will be primitive in nature and not depicted in any great detail.  The main focus of the game is intended to be story and most conflicts will arise from that.
The game will release with two maps, with more to be added in stages.  This won’t be an open world and travel will be depicted using a graphic rather than real time via characters walking between destinations.<br><br>
It is intended that each map will hold 10 minor hubs with one major hub per map.  The major hub will hold the inns (or resting place), which serves as the base for all player interactions with merchants and rest areas.<br><br>
The minor hubs will be village/small town areas with quest givers, crafting stations and short term rest areas.<br><br>
<b>Crafting</b><br><br>
A basic but complete crafting mechanic will be available.  It will not be compulsory but will however work as an adjunct for users to create armour, weapons and other items that may be required during the game.<br><br>
The crafting mechanics will include gathering resources, creating components and finally creating the final item.
Local tradespeople in the minor hubs will offer receipes, tools and other items for sale for in game currency.<br><br>
<b>Currency</b><br><br>
In game currency will be earned from quest givers and other non playable characters by completing quests, assisting with tasks, such as harvesting, animal husbandry and manual labour.  Currency may also be earned while travelling between hubs from non player characters with puzzles and other problems the player might want to solve.
It is intended that there will be sufficient ways to earn currency whether the user takes part in a facets of the game or not.<br><br>
<b>Story</b><br><br>
As mentioned, the game will be story focussed, with all activties the player takes part in contributing to world building.  Each non player character will play a part in immersing the player in the the game world.
There will be multiple branches to the story, where each decision the player takes, every quest giver missed, changes both the journey and the conclusion.  Replayability is key in the longevity of any role playing game and it the prime consideration of this game’s design.<br><br>
At this point in planning, it is intended to utilize the following during creation:<br><br>
<table>
<tr><th><p>Software</p></th>
	<th><p>Licence model</p></th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Unreal Engine 4</p></td>
	<td><p>Free for development<br>
		Publisher licence requires payment of a percentage of profits <cite>(see Unreal)</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>				
	<td><p>Unreal Engine HTML5</p></td>
	<td><p>Free to use <cite>(see Github)</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Yo Scenario</p></td>
	<td><p>Free to use <cite>(see Yo Scenario)</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Assets and 3d models</p></td>
	<td><p>Differing pricing models <cite>(see Hum3D)</cite></td></p>
</tr>
</table>
<p>There shouldn’t be any additional hardware required outside of existing personal computer and laptop.<br><br>
There will be an initial learning curve while learning the Engine and how to create the HTML5 code with that.  Unreal is a widely used engine and there are numerous resoures available for learning, including those available from Epic Games, the creater and owner of the engine. <cite>(see Unreal Engine)</cite>.<br><br>
Along with the engine, tools are available to assist in the creation and mapping of branching story writing <cite>(See Yo Scenario)</cite>.<br><br>
It should be reasonable to expect that with an initial time investment that the skills required to start the project can be gained.  Once the project has started, the work itself will aid in the growth of further skills.<br><br>
If the project is succesfully launched and uptake by users is good, we can perhaps hope that we can demonstrate that good, free games can be developed without the need to prey on sometimes vulnerable users.
